# pwc Power-BI-Job-Simulation---Forage

The primary goal of this project is to showcase my expertise in data visualization by developing Power BI dashboards that effectively illustrate key performance indicators (KPIs). These dashboards are designed not only to present data but also to facilitate meaningful insights, clearly addressing client requests with tailored, visually appealing solutions.

My strong communication skills shine through in my concise and informative email interactions with engagement partners. In these exchanges, I deliver valuable insights along with actionable recommendations derived from thorough data analysis, ensuring that key stakeholders are well-informed and equipped to make strategic decisions.

Furthermore, I utilized my analytical problem-solving abilities to delve into human resources data, placing a particular emphasis on gender-related KPIs. Through a comprehensive analysis, I successfully identified the underlying causes of gender balance issues at the executive management level. This work highlights my commitment to data-driven decision-making, as I strive to foster a more equitable workplace through informed strategies and insights.
